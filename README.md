* Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

  - Performed station analysis
  - Performed precipitation analysis


* Part 2: Design Your Climate App

   - Designed a Flask API based on the previously developed queries.

   -  Created the following routes:

          - /api/v1.0/stations
          
          - /api/v1.0/tobs
